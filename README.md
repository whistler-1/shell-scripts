# shell-scripts
A collection of bash and powershell scripts

nice-start.sh is my current startup script for bash, included at the bottom of `.bashrc`.
I also use eza as a replacement for ls, highly recommended.

`printDirWithFilecontents.PS1` is a powershell script that creates a text file with every file and each file's contents, as long as those contents are readable. I suppose it's a bit like a scraper lol - I used it because I wanted a single document with all the contents of a .NET project I was working on - tried feeding it to NotebookLM with lackluster results, but was happy with the script itself.
